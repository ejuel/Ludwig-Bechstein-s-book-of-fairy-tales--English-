# Ludwig Bechstein's book of fairy tales (English)
 Working to translate the public domain German version of Bechstein's book to English (images and german text retrieved from Project Gutenberg)

Plan to break up book into story segments of the format "00-Cover-TableOfContents"/"01-Story 1"

Will utilize Google Translate for initial translation, but possibly find german-english speakers to colaborate and make it flow more smoothly.

Book will remain in html format and HTML comment Tags will be used to identify areas of artistic license (as opposed to direct translations) when applicable.
