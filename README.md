# Ludwig Bechstein's book of fairy tales (English)
 Working to translate the public domain German version of Bechstein's book to English (images and german text retrieved from Project Gutenberg)

Goal is to retain the location names (with footnotes) along with the spirit of the stories. I practice telling the stories to my kids and make changes along the way. Hope to release version numbers tied to my oldest kid's age. 

Possibly add an index at end along with map of Germany with markers from the stories.

Plan to break up book into text file segments of the format "00-Cover-TableOfContents"/"01-Story 1"

Will utilize Google Translate for initial translation, but possibly find German-English speakers to colaborate and make it flow more smoothly (want to pay for their work, but not sure where the money will come from).

Might include comment tags to identify areas of artistic license when direct translation might interfer with the spirit of the story (language should be approachable for a young reader).
